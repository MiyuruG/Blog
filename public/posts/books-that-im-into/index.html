I always kind an unmotivated and I do feel like I need some help from someone and at the same time I don‚Äôt like to ask for help. I always keep my stuff with me. Furthermore, I don‚Äôt like to talk about my stuff, my life, what I am dealing with currently, how much fcked I am, etc. So it was like basically I am unmotivated. Because I was unmotivated, my productivity is in a range of a risk. Like I have my school stuff, my daily life stuff, etc. And I am not achieving them. My mind always reminds me do it soon as I can. But I can‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt have this energy in my body, in my mind. And in the same time I think I kind an act like a super sigma boy in my social life, in school, social media(mostly in discord), etc. In these days my laptop screen time is skyrocketing, Netflix, YouTube, Discord, etc. This does not mean I was just watching online content, most of my activities are based on Vibe Coding‚Ä¶ I like Vibe Coding ü•≤. So I looked for a hobby, a New Hobby. First I start to watch some movies (Yes Watching Content I Know!). And I downloaded a movie named ‚ÄúThe Fault In Our Stars‚Äù. And this is the start of my book reading journey!\nThe Movie made me read my first Book ![[Pasted image 20250901235216.png]] The Fault In Our Stars. The Fault In Our Stars was the movie that made me start reading for the first time.\nIt happened like this: one day I was watching some Instagram Reels and saw a really sad clip from a movie. The reel was from this movie ‚Äî Hazel Grace attending Gus‚Äôs funeral and giving a speech. It wasn‚Äôt Gus‚Äôs real funeral. Gus had just invited Hazel Grace to join his pre-funeral. I think Gus knew that he was going to die that day or the next. This ‚Äúfuneral‚Äù happened in the church, and Isaac was there too.\nThe reel came from that scene. Hazel gave a small speech, and it was heartbreaking. Because you see, all three of them (Hazel, Gus, and Isaac) had cancer, and they knew their lifespans were shorter than those of healthy people.\nI don‚Äôt know why, but it hit me so hard that I wanted to buy the book and read it after watching the movie. Maybe it‚Äôs because my mother died of cancer when I was 14.\nSo yeah, I‚Äôm not going to spoil too much here. You can watch the movie or read the book yourself. It‚Äôs a great story üíî.\nSo in the end, the reason I started to like reading books might just be that Instagram reel, lol.\nThe Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fck ![[Pasted image 20250908225039.png]] The Subtle Are Of Not Giving A Fck: There isn‚Äôt much of a story about this. So I‚Äôm a member of a discord server called The Bookerfly Club and in a one random day I was just looking around in the #currently-reading channel and I just saw someone had posted a picture of this book and ASAP I searched it on YouTube, in Google and I thought this is the self-help book that I was looking for, and I just brought it. And now I am currently reading it.\nThat‚Äôs it for now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll update this blog post in the future with more thoughts about reading and updates on my reading hobby.\nI‚Äôd also love to hear your thoughts on my blog post. Do you have any book recommendations for me?\n",
