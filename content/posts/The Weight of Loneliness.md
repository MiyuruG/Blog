If you don’t know what it feels like to be lonely, let me give you an example: Imagine a room full of people—friends, family, and familiar faces everywhere. And yet, even in the middle of that crowd, you feel invisible. It’s a **strange**, **heavy feeling**. That’s what loneliness is like, and that’s what I want to talk about here.

# How I Feel About Loneliness

Well, this is how I feel about loneliness: people ignore me, cut me off from their lives, they don’t treat me like they treat others. Sometimes my family members around my age get treated well, and I don’t. No matter how much I do for others, I don’t get anything in return. Even though I don’t expect much, it still feels like I’m invisible.

This blog post might be something I want the people around me to read, to maybe give me some attention. Maybe I *am* trying to get some attention through this blog. Or maybe not, because honestly, I know no one gives a sh!t about me anyway.

I feel empty. I feel like my life is meaningless. Furthermore, I feel like no matter how good I do my work, no matter how hard I try, it’s never enough for anyone. Maybe no one even notices, because everyone is too busy caring about their other friends—not me. Not even for a second.

No one texts me asking, *“How are you today?”* No one comes to me asking how my day went. No one even wastes their energy to wave at me from a distance.

So what am I trying to do here? Seeking attention, for sure. Why? Because I want to be mentioned. I want to be noticed. I’m a human being too—I want to be loved, I want to be cared for, I want to matter.
