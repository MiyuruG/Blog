Confession: I love collecting books more than finishing them.  
Iâ€™ve only fully read a few, some Iâ€™m halfway through, and others are still on my wishlist.  

This post is my **ongoing book list** â€” a mix of favorites, current reads, and books I plan to buy.  
Iâ€™ll keep updating it as I continue my reading journey.  

# Types of Books I Enjoy
Mainly, Iâ€™m into **Motivation, Romance, and Self-Help**.  
Thatâ€™s my taste â€” and here are some books that match it:

## I like to read Motivation and Self-Help books more thank anything
You see, that I have some issues in my life. I always kind a unmotivated and I do feel like I need some help from someone and at the same time I don't like to ask for help. I always keep my stuff with me. I don't like talk about my stuff, my life, what I am dealing with currently, how much fked I am, etc. So it was like basicly I am unmotivated. Because I was unmotivated my productivity is in a range of a risk. Like I have my school stuff, my daily life stuff, etc. And I am not achiving them. My mind always remind me do it soon as I can. But I cant, I dont have this energy in my body, in my mind. And in the same time I think I kind a act like a super sigma boy in my social life, in school, social media(*mostly in discord*), etc. In these days my laptop screen time is sky rocketing, Netflix, YouTube, Discord, etc etc. This dose not mean I was just watching online content, most of my activities are based on **Vibe Coding**... I like Vibe Coding ðŸ¥². So I looked for a hobby, a **New Hobby**. First I start to watch some movies (_Yes Watching Content I Know!_). And I downloaded a movie named "*The Fault In Our Stars*". And this is the start of my book reading jurney! 

## A Movie made me read my 1st Book
