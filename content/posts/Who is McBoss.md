# McBoss (About me)
Iâ€™m a student living in Sri Lanka. I am still going to school. 

### Hobbies
Furthermore, I have a lot of hobbies like 
- Coding
- Graphic Designing
- Sports
- Art
- Gaming
- Traveling

I have a lot of hobbies, and I think everyone has their own as well. I'd mention that I love to do coding as a hobby. And in that stream I like to do Vibe Coding, Game Dev and Website Building stuff. If I dig deeper into Game Dev as a hobby of mine, I am a complete beginner at right now. Currently, I only participated in a one Game Jam, with a teammate. Game development wasnâ€™t originally my hobby. My teammate convinced me to join a Game Jam, even though we knew we probably wouldnâ€™t place. It was a great experience, though, and now I love game developmentâ€”itâ€™s become a new hobby of mine. So big shoutout to my teammate. I canâ€™t mention his name since I didnâ€™t ask for permission. But if you guys dig a bit deeper into EXE 2025 Game Jam you will find my teammate. Again, a big shoutout to him. And I will make a New Blog post about the whole Game Jam after the ceremony. 

And I love to make apps like web apps, Windows apps etc. I usually use Python for everything. And I normally make an app for everything.

I play few games often. I don't play games like 24/7. Furthermore, I like Minecraft, Among US, etc. And I got a cheap Xbox 360 USB Edition controller too. I even have a Minecraft server to

### Dream
Like many students, I have a big dream. Well, it is leave this country and move to London or NYC. I like London more than NYC, but as a second opinion NYC is good ðŸ¥². 

### Currently
Um o currently I am a student as I mentioned earlier. And I am not doing a lot in school, like school subjects arenâ€™t my strongest suit. I believe that Education is a really useful tool for navigating life today. Because you need education to navigate todayâ€™s world. So Iâ€™ll keep doing it, even if Iâ€™m bad at it, and hopefully it will turn out great for me in the future.
