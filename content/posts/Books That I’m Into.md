Confession: I love collecting books more than finishing them.  
I‚Äôve only fully read a few, some I‚Äôm halfway through, and others are still on my wishlist.  

This post is my **ongoing book list** ‚Äî a mix of favorites, current reads, and books I plan to buy.  
I‚Äôll keep updating it as I continue my reading journey.  

# Types of Books I Enjoy
Mainly, I‚Äôm into **Motivation, Romance, and Self-Help**.  
That‚Äôs my taste ‚Äî and here are some books that match it:

## I like to read Motivation and Self-Help books more, thank anything
You see, that I have some issues in my life. I always kind an unmotivated and I do feel like I need some help from someone and at the same time I don't like to ask for help. I always keep my stuff with me. Furthermore, I don't like to talk about my stuff, my life, what I am dealing with currently, how much fcked I am, etc. So it was like basically I am unmotivated. Because I was unmotivated, my productivity is in a range of a risk. Like I have my school stuff, my daily life stuff, etc. And I am not achieving them. My mind always reminds me do it soon as I can. But I can't, I don't have this energy in my body, in my mind. And in the same time I think I kind an act like a super sigma boy in my social life, in school, social media(*mostly in discord*), etc. In these days my laptop screen time is skyrocketing, Netflix, YouTube, Discord, etc. This does not mean I was just watching online content, most of my activities are based on **Vibe Coding**... I like Vibe Coding ü•≤. So I looked for a hobby, a **New Hobby**. First I start to watch some movies (_Yes Watching Content I Know!_). And I downloaded a movie named "*The Fault In Our Stars*". And this is the start of my book reading journey! 

## The Movie made me read my first Book


![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250901235216.png)
[**The Fault In Our Stars**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582846/). **_The Fault In Our Stars_** was the movie that made me start reading for the first time.  

It happened like this: one day I was watching some Instagram Reels and saw a really sad clip from a movie. The reel was from this movie ‚Äî **Hazel Grace** attending **Gus**'s funeral and giving a speech. It wasn‚Äôt Gus‚Äôs real funeral. **Gus** had just invited **Hazel Grace** to join his pre-funeral. I think Gus knew that he was going to die that day or the next. This ‚Äúfuneral‚Äù happened in the church, and **Isaac** was there too.  

The reel came from that scene. **Hazel** gave a small speech, and it was heartbreaking. Because you see, all three of them (**Hazel, Gus, and Isaac**) had cancer, and they knew their lifespans were shorter than those of healthy people.  

I don‚Äôt know why, but it hit me so hard that I wanted to buy the book and read it after watching the movie. Maybe it‚Äôs because my mother died of cancer when I was 14.  

So yeah, I‚Äôm not going to spoil too much here. You can watch the movie or read the book yourself. It‚Äôs a great story üíî.  

So in the end, the reason I started to like reading books might just be that Instagram reel, lol.

## The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fck
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020250908225039.png)
[The Subtle Are Of Not Giving A Fck](https://jumpbooks.lk/product/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fuck/): There isn't much of a story about this. So I'm a member of a discord server called [The Bookerfly Club](https://discord.gg/GeRaaWPv7U) and in a one random day I was just looking around in the `#currently-reading` channel and I just saw someone had posted a picture of this book and ASAP I searched it on YouTube, in Google and I thought this is the self-help book that I was looking for, and I just brought it. And now I am currently reading it.

_That‚Äôs it for now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll update this blog post in the future with more thoughts about reading and updates on my reading hobby._
